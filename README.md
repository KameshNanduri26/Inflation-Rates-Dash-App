# Inflation-Rates-Project
This project shows the **inflation rates** from the years **1980 to 2022** of different **Countries, Economic Trade Unions, and the World Inflation** when given the respective appropriate input the the dropdown box.

# Details about the files
This project is created using **Dash App** which uses **Plotly Visualizations**.<br>

The original data is named as **inflation.xls**. To make it useful for our project I have preprocessed that data in **preprocessing.ipynb** file and saved the cleaned data as **modified_data.csv**.<br>

Then I had built a Dash app in **app.py**.

# To run the file
1. Clone the repository into your local machine.
2. Go to the project directory in the command line interface. Then run the following command:
* **python app.py**
3. Give the input from the dropdown box.

# App Interface
I have attached some **.png** files which shows the app interface and the visualization.
