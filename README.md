# Details about the files
This project is created using **Dash App** which uses **Plotly Visualizations**.<br>
The original data is named as **inflation.xls**. To make it useful for our project I have preprocessed that data in **preprocessing.ipynb** file and saved the cleaned data as **modified_data.csv**.<br>
Then I had built a Dash app in **app.py**.
